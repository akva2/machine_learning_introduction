    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "You first need to set up a Python environment (if you do not have done so already). The easiest way to do this is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). We will be using Python 3, so be sure to install the right version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you are not using Anaconda, and you already have a custom Python environment set up, possibly using a different Python version, it may be wise to [set up a virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) for this course so that it does not affect your existing environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Required packages\n",
    "Next, you'll need to install several packages that we'll be using extensively. You'll need to run these commands on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing packages with conda\n",
    "If you are using Anaconda, you can use the ``conda`` package manager to install all packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas pillow graphviz\n",
    "\n",
    "and then *also*\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install graphviz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing packages with pip\n",
    "With most other setups, you can use pip to install all packages. Pip is the Python Package index it is included in most Python installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas pillow graphviz\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we'll be using scikit-learn 0.18, which is currently the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need to install the graphiz C-library:  \n",
    "* OS X: use homebrew: ``brew install graphviz``\n",
    "* Ubuntu/debian: use apt-get: ``apt-get install graphviz``.\n",
    "* Installing graphviz on Windows can be tricky and using conda / anaconda is recommended."

    "As our coding environment, we'll be using Jupyter notebooks. They interleave documentation (in markdown) with executable Python code, and they run in your browser. That means that you can easily edit and re-run all the code in this course using only your browser, and you can make your own notes in your copy of the notebook as well.\n",
